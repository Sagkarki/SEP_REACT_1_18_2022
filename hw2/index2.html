    <h1>Strategy</h1>
    <p>Mark’s a technical trader. He studies charts and looks for very specific patterns. Beyond that, there are three technical indicators Mark looks for in every single trade: volume, volatility, and catalysts.

        Another thing to know about Mark is that he has a negative bias — he likes to short stocks more than he likes to go long. Mark usually buys weekly put options to cap his risk and leverage his gains.</p>
